=========================================================================
This is an app that centers around finding an accommodation for students. 
It allows the user to introduce Accomodations to other students. 
The app follows the Create, Read, Write and Delete database system whereby users can: 

1) ADD a hostel 

2) FIND ALL/ONE of the hostel  

3) DELETE the hostel 

4) THUMBS UP (recommending by voting) the hostel

When a user adds a unit it will demand an ID, type of hostel, distance from nearest college and rental cost.



A Git repository has been created for this app on 2 platforms: GitHub and Bit Bucket. 

The links are as follows:

GitHub - https://github.com/ngjs66/hostelweb

Bit Bucket - https://bitbucket.org/ngjs66/hostelweb/src/master/
While fiddling with the code provided in our labs, REST Client Test has been conducted to test if the POST, PUT, GET and DELETE Response & Request are carried out by the app. Albeit being quite confusing at first, eventually it is understood why it is important to create folders such as Models and Routes as proper management of the code allows easy referencing of where the code is stored and where it can be used.   

**Persistence** mLab is used as the cloud database service for storing data.
